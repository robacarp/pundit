## Inspiration

- The [Pundit](https://github.com/varvet/pundit) Ruby gem was what formed my need as a programmer for this kind of simple approach to authorization
- The [Praetorian](https://github.com/ilanusse/praetorian) Crystal shard took an excellent first step towards proving out the Pundit model in Crystal
